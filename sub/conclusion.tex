\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Bridge connecting biological regulatory networks and dynamical properties
    \item Reachability analysis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item PermReach and ASPReach: faster than traditional model checkers and more conclusive than pure static analysis $\to$ balance between complexity and completeness
        \item Deal with systems with up to $10^3$ automata
        \item \highlight{$\xRightarrow{\text{?}}$ Hybrid analyzer is more performing in reachability analysis}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Model learning and revision
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A comparatively new domain
        \item Generic solution vs. heuristics $\to$ balance between complexity and completeness
        \item \highlight{More metrics other than reachability are needed to obtain a more precise model} 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \highlight{More biological applications and discover more applicable domains}
\end{itemize}
